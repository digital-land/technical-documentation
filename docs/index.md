Welcome to the Planning Data Wiki. This is used by the members of the team to store documentation from a few key areas:

* [Architecture & Infrastructure](/architecture-and-infrastructure/) - A section on how we deploy our code in the cloud
* [Development](/development/) -  generall information for developers working on our projects
* Data Operations Manual - How data managers can control the data going in and coming out of our site
* [Run Book](/run-book/) - A list of incidents that took place on the site 

Everything in this wiki is a work in progress and is likely to evolve over time! 

Please visit our [website](planning.data.gov.uk) for morre information on our service!

#### Additional Reference Documentation:

* [specification](https://digital-land.github.io/specification/) - contains information about the data we produce and any data generated along the way
