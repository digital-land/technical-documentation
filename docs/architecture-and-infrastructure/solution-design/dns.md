# Solution design - DNS

## Overview

The Domain Name System (DNS) setup for the planning data service involves the delegation of the planning subdomain from![img.png](img.png) the data.gov.uk domain which is managed by GDS (Government Digitial Service).  A name server lookup for the planning name server record reveals the following:

```shell
$ nslookup -q=ns planning.data.gov.uk
Server:		fe80::d686:60ff:fe40:eb3d%15
Address:	fe80::d686:60ff:fe40:eb3d%15#53

Non-authoritative answer:
planning.data.gov.uk	nameserver = ns-519.awsdns-00.net.
planning.data.gov.uk	nameserver = ns-1995.awsdns-57.co.uk.
planning.data.gov.uk	nameserver = ns-79.awsdns-09.com.
planning.data.gov.uk	nameserver = ns-1442.awsdns-52.org.
```

The four nameserver records returned refer to the planning.data.gov.uk Route 53 zone in our production AWS account.  From that zone, further delegations have been made for our non-production environments:

 * staging.planning.data.gov.uk
 * development.planning.data.gov.uk

The delegations correspond to the Route 53 zones in the staging and development AWS accounts.
