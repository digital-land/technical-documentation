## 2.2 Frontend Web Application

**Container Name:** ___________________

**Architecture Pattern:** ⬜ Server-Side Rendered (SSR) ⬜ Static Site Generation (SSG) ⬜ Client-Side SPA ⬜ Hybrid

**Rendering Approach:**
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** HTML generated on server for each request. Recommended for GDS compliance, accessibility, and SEO.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG):** HTML pre-generated at build time. Good for content-heavy sites with infrequent changes.
- **Client-Side SPA:** JavaScript renders content in browser. May not meet GDS/accessibility standards without careful implementation.
- **Hybrid:** Combination of approaches (e.g., SSR for public pages, SPA for authenticated areas).

**Note:** For UK Government services, GDS Service Manual requires progressive enhancement and services that work without JavaScript. Client-side SPAs typically do not meet these requirements unless using SSR/SSG with hydration.

## 2.3a Hybrid Web Application + API Container

**Container Name:** ___________________

**Use Case:** Single container serving both web pages (HTML) and API endpoints (JSON/XML). Common for public-facing services that need both a user interface and programmatic access.

**Examples:**
- Government service with public web pages AND an API for partners
- Documentation site that also exposes data via API
- Admin interface bundled with management API
- Legacy monolith serving both concerns

### Hybrid Container Documentation
- [ ] Clear separation between web routes and API routes is documented
- [ ] URL structure distinguishes web pages from API (e.g., /api/* for APIs)
- [ ] Versioning strategy for APIs doesn't affect web pages
- [ ] Deployment strategy handles both concerns
- [ ] Whether web and API share authentication/authorization is documented

### Architecture Clarity
- [ ] Web page routes are clearly identified (e.g., /, /about, /contact)
- [ ] API routes are clearly identified (e.g., /api/v1/*, /api/v2/*)
- [ ] Static asset routes documented (e.g., /assets/*, /public/*)
- [ ] Health check endpoints separated (e.g., /health for web, /api/health for API)
- [ ] Middleware/filters distinguish between web and API requests

### Content Type Handling
- [ ] Content negotiation correctly routes to HTML or JSON responses
- [ ] Accept headers properly handled (text/html vs application/json)
- [ ] Error responses appropriate for context (HTML error pages vs JSON errors)
- [ ] 404 handling differs between web (error page) and API (JSON error)
- [ ] CORS only applied to API routes, not web pages

### Security Considerations
- [ ] CSRF protection enabled for web forms but not API endpoints
- [ ] API authentication separate from web session management (if different users)
- [ ] Rate limiting configured separately for web vs API traffic
- [ ] Security headers appropriate for each (CSP for web, CORS for API)
- [ ] Session management doesn't interfere with API token validation

### Web Functionality (within Hybrid Container)
- [ ] Server-side rendering of HTML (SSR pattern)
- [ ] Template engine configured (Jinja2, EJS, Handlebars, etc.)
- [ ] Progressive enhancement principles followed
- [ ] Static file serving configured and optimized
- [ ] Client-side JavaScript enhancement is optional, not required
- [ ] Web forms work without JavaScript

### API Functionality (within Hybrid Container)
- [ ] JSON/XML serialization properly configured
- [ ] API documentation accessible (e.g., /api/docs via Swagger UI)
- [ ] API versioning doesn't conflict with web routes
- [ ] API responses don't accidentally return HTML
- [ ] OpenAPI spec generation automated

### Performance Separation
- [ ] Caching strategies differ between web pages and API
- [ ] Static assets cached aggressively (long TTL)
- [ ] API responses cached appropriately (shorter TTL, conditional caching)
- [ ] CDN configuration handles both static files and dynamic content
- [ ] Resource limits consider both web traffic and API calls

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Metrics separated by traffic type (web vs API)
- [ ] Logging distinguishes web requests from API calls
- [ ] Dashboards show both web page performance and API performance
- [ ] Alerts configured for both web availability and API availability
- [ ] Usage analytics track web visitors separately from API consumers

### Testing Strategy
- [ ] E2E tests for web user journeys
- [ ] Contract tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Integration tests verify web and API don't interfere
- [ ] Load testing covers realistic mix of web and API traffic
- [ ] Accessibility testing for web pages
- [ ] API compatibility testing

### When to Consider Splitting
Consider separating into distinct containers when:
- [ ] Web and API have significantly different scaling needs
- [ ] Different teams own web vs API
- [ ] API versioning complicates web deployment
- [ ] Security requirements differ substantially
- [ ] Performance characteristics conflict (e.g., API needs high throughput, web needs low latency)
- [ ] Want independent deployment cycles

### Advantages of Hybrid Approach
- Simpler infrastructure (single deployment)
- Shared authentication/authorization logic
- Single codebase for related concerns
- Easier to maintain consistency
- Lower operational overhead

### Disadvantages of Hybrid Approach
- Harder to scale independently
- Deployment risk affects both concerns
- Potential for security configuration conflicts
- Mixing of concerns can complicate code
- Different performance characteristics may conflict
