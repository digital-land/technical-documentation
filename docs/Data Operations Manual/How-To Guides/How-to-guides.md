There are a set of key processes that enable us to operate the platform. Hopefully we'll migrate these to an application when we get the chance!

The set of processes are as follows:

• [Validate An Endpoint](Validate-an-endpoint)

• [Adding A Dataset/Collection](Add-a-new-dataset-and-collection)

• [Adding An Endpoint](Add-an-endpoint)

• [Configuring An Endpoint](Configure-an-endpoint)

• [Assigning Entities](Assign-entities)

• [Merging Entities](Merge-entities)

• [Retiring An Endpoint](Retire-endpoints)

• [Retiring A Resource](Retire-resources)

• [Retiring Entities](Retire-entities)

• [Publish A Jupyter Notebook](Publish-A-Jupyter-Notebook)
