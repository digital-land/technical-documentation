### Team Structure and Guidance

**Team Setup**
- Teams are split across three key areas:
  - **DevOps**
  - **Application Development**
  - **Data Engineering**

- Each sprint, members from the Platform and Infrastructure team are assigned to work on Live Service issues. 

**Scope of Work**
- The team will handle platform-related issues only. 
- Data-related issues faced by external users (e.g., LPAs) will be managed by the Data Management Team. 
- Sentry tickets related to the Providers service are handled by the Providers team. However, these will transition to the Live Service team when the tool enters BAU.

**Ongoing Tasks**
- Where no critical Live Service issues arise, team members will pick up tasks from the Live Service backlog.
- Regular processes, such as bug triage, will be reviewed to identify areas for improvement.
- Feedback will be actively sought from all teams to refine processes and practices.

**People**
- A rota for all developers in the Platform & Infrastructure team will be created. This will ensure that all areas of expertise (DevOps, Application Development, Data Engineering) are represented in the Live Service team, however each member will only be rotaed on for one sprint before returning to Continuous Improvement work.
