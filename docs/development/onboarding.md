# Onboarding Checklist

This is a curated task list aimed at devs joining the team. It attempts to tackle both generalized and specific tasks that should be undertaken on joining including laptop set-up, reading to do and some suggestions on sessions to get set up.

General:
- Read the planning data handbook
- Run through our introductory tutorial on setting up your machine. This focuses on installing general software that is good to have for everyone:
    - for Mac users see [Set Up for Mac](/development/tutorials/set-up-for-mac/)

Now based on the areas you'll be focusing on there are some specific checklists below. This is done to stop everyone installing everything however if you're asked to do work that crosses between the boundaries you can come back and do others later.
