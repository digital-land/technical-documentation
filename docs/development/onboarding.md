title: Onboarding Checklist
---

> NOTE  
> This is currently a Work In Progress 

This is a curated task list aimed at devs joining the team. It attempts to tackle both generalized and specific tasks that should be undertaken on joining including laptop set-up, reading to do and some suggestions on sessions to get set up.

### General:
- Read the planning data handbook
- Run through our introductory tutorial on setting up your machine. This focuses on installing general software that is good to have for everyone:
    - for Mac users see [Set Up for Mac](/development/tutorials/set-up-for-mac/)
- Read through [Onboarding in Data Operations](/data-operations-manual/Tutorials/Onboarding/) this gives a good overview of questions you should ask as you look through what is being developed here.

Now based on the areas you'll be focusing on there are some specific checklists below. This is done to stop everyone installing everything however if you're asked to do work that crosses between the boundaries you can come back and do others later.

### Data Engineering:

- TBD

### Application Development:

#### 1. Clone the Key Repositories
Download the two applications that are currently run as a live service that you will likely need to work on:  
- [Planning Data API](https://github.com/digital-land/digital-land.info)
- [Submit Service](https://github.com/digital-land/submit)

There are more repositories to explore, but start with these.

#### 2. Set Up and Run the Applications
- Follow the [Planning Data Repo Tutorial](/development/tutorials/planning-data-info-repo/)
- Follow the [Submit Service Repo Tutorial](/development/tutorials/submit-tutorial/) for an overview of the application architecture, instructions to get it working, and key points about the service architecture.

#### 3. Adopt Best Practices
Going forward, all projects should follow the [best practices outlined here](/development/best-practice/). You should be able to use the following commands to start the service:

```bash
make init
make run
```

### DevOps:

- TBD
