# Centralising Pipeline Configuration

We are in the process of centralising files from all of the collection repos. this is to
support the migration to AWS and also allow us to build up the processes in the config
manager app so that anyone can add an endpoint.

## Progression

See the table below on what has been centralised.

|Collection|Status|Link|
| legislation | complete | [here](https://github.com/digital-land/legislation-collection) |
| title boundary | requested | [here](https://github.com/digital-land/title-boundary-collection) |
| national park | requested | [here](https://github.com/digital-land/national-park-collection) |
| ancient woodland | requested | [here](https://github.com/digital-land/ancient-woodland-collection) |
| historic englnd | requested | [here](https://github.com/digital-land/historic-england-collection) |

## Process

The process for centralising a collection's config file is as follows:

* clone config repository if needed (if already cloned then make sure up to date)
* run script X to edit the local files on a branch of config and a branch of the colleciton
* Merge branches in
* Edit the README to state that it has been centralised
* Update list above to show that it has been centralised
