## Reference

This section of our documentation provides authoritative information about the software.

NOTE: Collection vs collection. A Collection with a capital C is the thing we are gathering - Tree Preservation Orders is a Collection, for example. When we use the term 'collection' with a small c then we mean the __activity__ of getting the data for a Collection. The collector is a term we sometimes use for the part of the software that collects the data.
