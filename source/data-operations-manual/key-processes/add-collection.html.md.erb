# Creating A Collection

This is needed when adding a dataset that doesn't belong to one of the collections
that already exist.

#### 1. Ensure the collection is noted in the specification

Not doing this won't result in any specific errors but it should be done to ensure that the list of collections in the specification is up to date. This should be done with some visiability from the standards team

#### 2. Use the [collection-template](https://github.com/digital-land/collection-template) to create a repository

The `collection-template` repo is a template repository which can be used to create
new collection repos. This is fairly simple using the Github UI. there is an option
to use the template to create a new repo if you navigate to the `collection-template`
page

#### 3. Update `.README`

Update the details in the readme file.

#### 4. Deactivate actions

The collection comes with the action ready to run every night. This should be paused until
your ready for it to be ran. This can be done by commenting out the following lines in the `.github
/workflows/run_caller.yaml` :

```
schedule:
- cron: 0 0 * * *
```

#### 5. Add endpoints, edit pipeline config files and test locally.

This is where you need to get the pipeline running locally. see our other
processes on this page for how to add data

#### 6. Re-activate actions

Once the collection is ready to be ran nightly uncomment the line from above in
the git workflow yaml file and it will start running nightly!

**Process Review**

Everything else is done so it's worth reviewing this process and seeing if there's
anyway we can improve it!
