# Key Processes

There are a set of key processes that we need to do to the platform to ensure it is getting data onto it and it is getting the correct data. 
Specifically there are two processes that are essential, validating an endpoint and adding an endpoint. but there are several others that
data management require us to do. the dream is to migrate these processes to an application but that will take time. While we build this
we need to continue to operate the platform.

The set of processes are as follows:

• [Validating An Endpoint](/key-processes/validate-endpoint.html)

• [Adding An Endpoint](/key-processes/add-endpoint.html)

• [Creating A New Collection](/key-processes/add-collection.html)

• [Adding A New Dataset](/key-processes/add-dataset.html)

• [Ending An Endpoint](/key-processes/end-endpoint.html)

• [Retiring A Resource](/key-processes/retire-resource.html)

• [Assigning Entity Number To Entries](/key-processes/assign-entities.html)
