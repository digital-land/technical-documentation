# Merging Entities

---
:warning: We are currently attempting to centralise both pipeline and collection configuration files. This process is very similar for both 
centralised and non-centralised collections the only difference is the change in the location of the old-entity.csv. 
See for a list of collections that we are working on.
---

add-redirections command redirects given entities using the entity numbers by adding entries in the old-entity.csv file.

#### 1. create a csv file with duplicated entity numbers

Find or generate a csv file of the entries that need to be added
to the collection. Make a note of the location. The following columns need to be included in the csv:

- `entity_source` - entity number to redirect
- `entity_destination` - entity number to which the entity_source should point to

```
entity_source,entity_destination
```

For example:

```
entity_source,entity_destination
100,200
101,201
```

#### 2. run command

```
digital-land add-redirections <csv-file-path>
```

For example in an individual collection repo:
```
digital-land add-redirections import.csv
```

Or in the centralised config folder:

```
digital-land add-redirections import.csv -p ./pipeline/[COLLECTION_NAME]
```

This will add entries in the old-entity.csv file in the required format.
The entity number provided in entity_source will get redirected to entity_destination.
