:warning: We are currently attempting to centralise both pipeline and collection configuration files. This process is very similar for both 
centralised and non-centralised collections the only difference is the change in the location of the old resource csv. 
See for a list of collections that we are working on.

# Retiring A Resource
Sometimes a resource should not continue to be processed and included in the platform. this can happen for a few different reasons an example would be that it contains significant errors and therefore should be removed.

#### 1. Identify resource hashes
In order to remove a resource the main thing you’ll need is the hash value for the resource. There are a number of ways to find this by examining tables in datasette or running `make collection` and examining the resource.csv

#### 2. add rows to `old-resource.csv`
for each resource you want to retire you’ll need to to create a row in the old-resource.csv (either in the individiual collection repo or the config repo). For each row you’ll need the following information:
* `old-resource` - the resource hash you identified above
* `status` - for retiring a resource this should be `410`
* `resource` - not needed for retiring an endpoint
* `notes` - details on why the resource should no longer be processed

### Process for removing entities by ending its endpoint and retiring its resource

#### 1. Get a list of entities to remove
The list of entities should contain details like entity-number, reference, name and org.

#### 2. Find the fact hash for entity you want to remove
On Datasette, find the collection db
Open fact table
Filter the fact table with org name and entity-number
Find the the fact hash for the entity you want to remove

#### 3. Find the endpoint and resource given entity details
Open fact_resource table
Get the resource hash using the fact hash identified in step 2
Use digital_land/resource_endpoint table to get the endpoint hash

#### 4. Use Ending an endpoint and retiring a resource process
Endpoint an endpoint can be found here data-operations-manual/key-processes/end-endpoint.html.md.erb

**Process Review**

Everything else is done so it's worth reviewing this process and seeing if there's
anyway we can improve it!
