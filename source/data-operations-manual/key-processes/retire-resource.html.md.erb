# Retiring A Resource
Sometimes a resource should not continue to be processed and included in the platform. this can happen for a few different reasons an example would be that it contains significant errors and therefore should be removed.

#### 1. Identify resource hashes
In order to remove a resource the main thing you’ll need is the hash value for the resource. There are a number of ways to find this by examining tables in datasette or running `make collection` and examining the resource.csv

#### 2. add rows to `old-resource.csv`
for each resource you want to retire you’ll need to to create a row in the csv. For each row you’ll need the following information:
* `old-resource` - the resource hash you identified above
* `status` - for retiring a resource this should be `410`
* `resource` - not needed for retiring an endpoint
* `notes` - details on why the resource should no longer be processed

Everything else is done so it's worth reviewing this process and seeing if there's
anyway we can improve it!
