# Assigning Entities


---
:warning: We are currently attempting to centralise both pipeline and collection configuration files. There are
two sets of instructions below depending on whether we have centralised the files for the collection you are 
altering. See [here](/centralising-config/index.html) for a list of collections that we are working on.
---

## Assigning Entities Non-centralised Process

For our service to recognise data from a provider, it must be assigned an entity number in the lookup.csv for the collection.
This happens automatically when running the add-endpoints-and-lookups script, but sometimes you may want to run this process by itself.
For instance, if an endpoint already on the system is updated with a new resource with new entries, these new entries will need to be assigned entity numbers.
The command for this process is as follows:

```
digital-land assign-entities <path-to-resource> <collection-name>
```

For example:
```
digital-land assign-entities collection/resource/1b8ee25a45cf6e874e4822f2e9b0e83c01df18a73d962b4d376dae1288018b4c article-4-direction
```

Note that the resource must have been processed by the pipeline for this process to work.

**Process Review**

Everything else is done so it's worth reviewing this process and seeing if there's
anyway we can improve it!

our files.planning.data.gov.uk

```
digital-land assign-entities [PATTH_TO_RESOURCE] [COLLECTION_NAME] -p ./pipeline/[COLLECTION_NAME]
```

For example:
