# Assigning Entities

For our service to recognise data from a provider, it must be assigned an entity number in the lookup.csv for the collection.
This happens automatically when running the add-endpoints-and-lookups script, but sometimes you may want to run this process by itself.
For instance, if an endpoint already on the system is updated with a new resource with new entries, these new entries will need to be assigned entity numbers.
The command for this process is as follows:

```
digital-land assign-entities <path-to-resource> <collection-name>
```

For example:
```
digital-land assign-entities collection/resource/1b8ee25a45cf6e874e4822f2e9b0e83c01df18a73d962b4d376dae1288018b4c article-4-direction
```

Note that the resource must have been processed by the pipeline for this process to work.

**Process Review**

Everything else is done so it's worth reviewing this process and seeing if there's
anyway we can improve it!
