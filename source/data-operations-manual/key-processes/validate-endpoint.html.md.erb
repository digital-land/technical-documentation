# Validating an Endpoint

We offer two complimentary ways of doing this - a quick way using the Endpoint Checker, and a more thorough manual method.



### Validating an Endpoint using the command-line

This gives a fuller view of how the endpoint will be handled by the pipeline.

#### Prerequisites
1. Clone the collection repository locally.
1. Create and activate a virtual environment within the collection folder you just cloned.
1. Run these commands:

```bash
make makerules
make init
make
```

If you're looking at large endpoint, you can speed things up a bit by removing all the folders in collection/log and all entries from collection/endpoint.csv.

#### Validating an endpoint locally
The command takes the form shown below: 

```
digital-land collection-add-source <collection-name> <endpoint-url> organisation <organisation-name> documentation-url <documentation url>
```

All the fields given above are required, as shown in the example below:

```
digital-land collection-add-source brownfield-land htts://data.fulchester.gov.uk/brownfield/brownfield20230922.csv organisation <organisation-name> documentation-url <documentation url>
```

    
optional fields:
pipelines <dataset/pipeline> use this when dataset name is different from the collection name
licence <licence>
attribution <attribution>
    
Note :
Organisation-name format - local-authority-eng:ABC
If there is an error saying command not found make sure prerequisite steps are followed.


1. Run pipeline by running the ‘make’ command – this ensures that the resource has been downloaded by the collector
1. Go to collection/log -> search for endpoint hash you added (can be found from collection/endpoint.csv) -> open file
Make sure the status parameter has value 200 which means that the end endpoint link is valid.
If not then raise this as an issue by creating a new card
