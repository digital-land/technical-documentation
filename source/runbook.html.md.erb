This document contains some basic instructions for fixing common issues encountered operating the service.

## Outage Procedure

When an outage occurs the following process should be followed.

* Post a message into the team chat in slack
  * Replace **AFFECTED_APPLICATIONS** with a list of services that are down
  * Replace **MEET_LINK** with a google meet link [create a new one here](https://meet.new)
  * Replace **INCIDENT_RESPONSE_DOCUMENT** with a google doc link [create a new one here](https://doc.new)

```
@here *Service Outage*

AFFECTED_APPLICATIONS

MEET_LINK

INCIDENT_RESPONSE_DOCUMENT
```

* All team members must join the google meet link and begin documenting the outage.

Resolving an outage is an iterative process that should be improved with the lessons learnt from the previous outages.
It is suggested that the outage document contain the following headers to direct work appropriately.

Outage Roles:

* **Scribe** The role of scribe is to maintain the incident report document during diagnosis and resolution of the outage.
  * Requires edit access to the google document tracking the incident.
  * Requires read-write access to the technical documentation repository.
* **Observer** The role of observer is to keep track of changes made to application and infrastructure code, approving
    any pull requests where needed.
  * Requires read-only access to the AWS account hosting the applications that are experiencing an outage.
  * Requires read-write access to any GitHub repositories hosting code for the applications that are experiencing an outage.
* **Actor** The role of actor is to be the only person who makes changes to application code and deployed infrastructure.
  * Requires read-write access to the AWS account hosting the applications that are experiencing an outage.
  * Requires read-write access to any GitHub repositories hosting code for the applications that are experiencing an outage.

* **Outage - APPLICATION - DATE (YYYY-MM-DD format)**
* **In attendance** - a list of people who have responded to the outage and the roles they have taken.
* **Description** - A brief description of the outage, including affected services
* **Running log** - Put timestamped entries under here including actions, observations, etc.
    * Action **TIME We did x, under advice from / because.**
    * Observation **TIME We observed that x happened.**
* **Postmortem** - A few paragraphs explaining the root cause of the issue and what measures have been taken to mitigate
further instances.

It is worth checking the [incident response history](#incident-response-history)

Once the outage has been resolved it is a good idea to take a break before reflecting on the outage and completing the
postmortem section of the document. Once the document is complete, the contents must be copied under the section
[Incident Response History](#incident-response-history) for future reference.
