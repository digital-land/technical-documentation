## Python versions on WSL2

While these notes are mainly aimed at WSL2 users, these notes equally apply to any recent Ubuntu installation.

The pipeline currently runs on Python 3.8, so this is the version developers should run. Ubuntu 22.04
(Jammy Jellyfish) - which is the latest version used by WSL2 at the time of writing (January 2024) does not include
a package for python 3.8.

### Using Python 3.8

The easiest way to install python 3.8 is from the [deadsnakes](https://github.com/deadsnakes) repository.

    $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
    $ sudo apt install python3.8
    $ sudo apt install python3.8-venv

Then create [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for Python 3.8 with
```python3.8 -m venv``` such as

    $ python3.8 -m venv .venv --clear --prompt $(basename $(pwd))
    
To check that the virtual environment is indeed using Python 3.8 run

    $ source .venv/bin/activate
    $ python -V

Which should display ```Python 3.8.18```


### Using a later version too

Even with python3.8 installed, the later (system) version of python will still be installed. In fact, this
will be the default version of python (unless someone has tinkered with the system). From ouside of any
virtual environment ```python -V``` should report the later version (currently ```Python 3.10.12```).

Virtual environments can be created for this version with ```python -m venv``` as usual.

It's worth noting that the system version of python can change with a Ubuntu update. If a specific version is required,
it would be best to install it from deadsnakes in a similar way to installing 3.8.
