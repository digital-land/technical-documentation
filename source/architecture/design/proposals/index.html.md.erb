# Open Design Proposals

## Intro

A useful overview of Open Design Proposals is provided by Rory80hz in his blog post
["You must think first, before you move."](https://medium.com/kainos/you-must-think-first-before-you-move-7ac4af0346a9#.46z3j3z7r)

When creating a new proposal, please refer to the
[Open Design Proposal template](/architecture/design/proposals/template.html).

Ideally leave a proposal open for a couple of weeks to allow adequate time for review.  It's also useful to socialise a new proposal
to proactively draw attention from people from various disciplines (e.g. dev, ops, qa, sec, ba etc.).
