# Data Operations Manual For Config
(This is still a work in progress)
We have two main goals:

* To collect data from external organisations published in accordance with data specifications we created,
* and make it available as part of a national dataset.

The planning data service relies upon a set of data workflows to achieve that goal.

### Audience for this document
This document is intended for people who need to run data operations for the Planning Data Platform. It is not intended as a manual for software developers on the project, but it does occasionally stray into the world of programming. This doc links out to repositories on [github](https://github.com/digital-land) where we host a mix of code and data.
