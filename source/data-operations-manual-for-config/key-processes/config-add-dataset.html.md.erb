# Adding A Dataset

These requests will likely be few and far between but will happen and will require
co-ordination between both the operations and standards teams. Requests will likely
come from both the data manager and the standards team.

#### 1. Ensure the dataset has been added to the specification

Before resources can be processed for a dataset the dataset itself needs to be registered
in the specification. This includes recording which fields are needed at the end of the pipeline
and the entity number range.

This should be done by the standards team before datasets are requested to come
to the platform but if not it's worth involving them here before you continue.

Note: Don't include a collection in the dataset specification until the dataset set should go
on the site. this will allow you to run the pipeline and push data to s3 without
it being added to the platform

#### 2. Identify or create a collection

A dataset HAS to be added to a collection. If there isn't already one
then view the process to add a collection and follow the initial steps.

#### 3. Identify and add an endpoint for the dataset

Once the above steps have been taken the only thing needed to be done is to add endpoints for the dataset. this can be done using our add endpoints process.

Note: if you are adding a dataset that is 'hosted' by us then it can be put in a data folder of the repo and the raw github link e.g. `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digital-land/ancient-woodland-collection/main/data/ancient-woodland-status.csv` can then be used as an endpoint.

#### 4. Test locally and in GHA

it's worth testing the dataset locally and in the GHA. this ensures that everything is working as expected. configuratino files can be altered to ensure it works as expected.

#### 5. Add the collection to the dataset in the specification

This will signal that the dataset should be loaded into the postgresql DB behind the platform. once this step is done when the collection is ran it'll upload to the platform.

**Process Review**

Everything else is done so it's worth reviewing this process and seeing if there's
anyway we can improve it!
