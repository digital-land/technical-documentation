# Creating A Collection

This is needed when adding a dataset that doesn't belong to one of the collections
that already exist.

#### 1. Ensure the collection is noted in the specification

Not doing this won't result in any specific errors but it should be done to ensure that the list of collections in the specification is up to date. This should be done with some visiability from the standards team

#### 2. Create Collection and Pipeline folders in repo

The config repo currently contains collection and pipeline folders for each unique collection held within the pipeline. When adding the collection simply create folders named as they are displayed in the specification

#### 3. Add relevant files

Update the new collection folders by adding in the relevant files which are required of the pipeline ie in the collection folder you would have endpoint.csv, old-resource.csv and source.csv. And in the pipeline folder you will have the relevant configuration files.

#### 4. Add endpoints, edit pipeline config files and test locally.

This is where you need to get the pipeline running locally. see our other
processes on this page for how to add data

**Process Review**

Everything else is done so it's worth reviewing this process and seeing if there's
anyway we can improve it!
