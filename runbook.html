<p>This document contains some basic instructions for fixing common issues encountered operating the service.</p>
<h2 id="outage-procedure">Outage Procedure</h2>
<p>When an outage occurs the following process should be followed.</p>

<ul>
<li>Post a message into the team chat in slack

<ul>
<li>Replace <strong>AFFECTED_APPLICATIONS</strong> with a list of services that are down</li>
<li>Replace <strong>MEET_LINK</strong> with a google meet link <a href="https://meet.new">create a new one here</a></li>
<li>Replace <strong>INCIDENT_RESPONSE_DOCUMENT</strong> with a google doc link <a href="https://doc.new">create a new one here</a></li>

</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext" tabindex="0"><code>@here *Service Outage*

AFFECTED_APPLICATIONS

MEET_LINK

INCIDENT_RESPONSE_DOCUMENT
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>All team members must join the google meet link and begin documenting the outage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Resolving an outage is an iterative process that should be improved with the lessons learnt from the previous outages.
It is suggested that the outage document contain the following headers to direct work appropriately.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Outage - APPLICATION - DATE (YYYY-MM-DD format)</strong></li>
<li><strong>In attendance</strong> - a list of people who have responded to the outage and the roles they have taken.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong> - A brief description of the outage, including affected services</li>
<li><strong>Running log</strong> - Put timestamped entries under here including actions, observations, etc.

<ul>
<li>Action <strong>TIME We did x.</strong></li>
<li>Observation <strong>TIME We observed that x happened.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Postmortem</strong> - A few paragraphs explaining the root cause of the issue and what measures have been taken to mitigate
further instances.</li>
</ul>
<p>Outage Roles:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Scribe</strong> The role of scribe is to maintain the incident report document during diagnosis and resolution of the outage.

<ul>
<li>Requires edit access to the google document tracking the incident.</li>
<li>Requires read-write access to the technical documentation repository.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Observer</strong> The role of observer is to keep track of changes made to application and infrastructure code, approving
any pull requests where needed.

<ul>
<li>Requires read-only access to the AWS account hosting the applications that are experiencing an outage.</li>
<li>Requires read-write access to any GitHub repositories hosting code for the applications that are experiencing an outage.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Actor</strong> The role of actor is to be the only person who makes changes to application code and deployed infrastructure.

<ul>
<li>Requires read-write access to the AWS account hosting the applications that are experiencing an outage.</li>
<li>Requires read-write access to any GitHub repositories hosting code for the applications that are experiencing an outage.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>It is worth checking the <a href="#incident-response-history">incident response history</a></p>
<p>Once the outage has been resolved it is a good idea to take a break before reflecting on the outage and completing the
postmortem section of the document. Once the document is complete, the contents must be copied under the section
<a href="#incident-response-history">Incident Response History</a> for future reference, taking care to remove any secret
information from the document.</p>

<p>At 5.09 on Friday the 29th of September, Paul Downey posted in the main Slack channel that the url param key for the dataset has changed from dataset to layer. He advised that this needed reverting, and any urls pointing to the old key needed to be redirected.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>George started investigations at 9.11am on the 2nd October, finding that the specified key for the dataset param had
been overwritten as part of the refactor/map component update here: https://github.com/digital-land/digital-land.info/pull/133</p></li>
<li><p>An initial fix was deployed at 10.35am that reverted the key back to dataset, and added a function to change any urls with the old key to the new key.</p></li>
<li><p>A second PR was deployed at 11.08am that added a test to check that the url param key was correct and that the old key was correctly changed to the new key.</p></li>
<li><p>These changes were reviewed, approved and merged by Mark at 11:08 and available on the live site a few minutes later.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="analysis">Analysis</h4>
<p>We did not appreciate that people were using the direct link off the browser to access the map.</p>
<p>When applying updates to the map code, we overwrote the code that specified the dataset url param key. This change was not picked up in manual testing or code reviews. There were no automated tests covering this case, and as the change was inadvertent, we did not write any new ones.</p>
<h4 id="lessons-to-be-learned">Lessons to be learned</h4>
<p>The original change came in as part of a much largeer set of code changes. It was not noticed in code review. Code reviews are not as effective when dealing with extensive changes. Next time, let us find ways to not create large pull-requests with hundreds of lines of changes.</p>

<p>On the morning of 14th August 2023 when Ernest logged on around 9am in the morning and noticed the aws alarms was raised in our 
slcak channel for datasette and datasette-tiles. Getting 502 error for both endpoints and diagnostic procedures started at that point.</p>
<h4 id="aws-alarms-raised-for-datasette-and-datasette-tiles-canaries-2023-08-14-running-log">Running log</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Ernest and Owen started investigation at around 9am. We getting 502 when we hit those endpoints directly. The issue seems only 
affecting Production environment as we cannot see the same in the lower environments (Dev and staging). So we suspect this is more of 
a platform related issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Ernest and Owen have look at varies area in the production platform, inclued ECS, collection pipeline, RDS postgres database etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Main symptoms:</p>

<ul>
<li>both datasette and datasette-tiles applications crashed in prod leading to a 502 bad gateway</li>
<li>ECS task is unable to launch any new instances as they do not pass health checks</li>
<li>National map may not be able to access our tiles</li>
<li>Fact pages on the site will be unavailable</li>
<li>Reporting may be affected as cannot access production datasette</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary of the issue: The EFS throughput is too high during the nightly data update. This caused by the 
pipeline dumped files and datasette applications restarting.</p>
<h4 id="aws-alarms-raised-for-datasette-and-datasette-tiles-canaries-2023-08-14-postmortem">Postmortem</h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://trello.com/c/KNB7k4ee">Live incident ticket</a> have been created.</li>
<li>EFS have now upgraded to use &ldquo;Elastic&rdquo; throughput mode.</li>
<li>Ernest will continous monitoring any cost implications in aws Cost Explorer</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>On (2023-08-14)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>a temporary fix have been implemented by reducing the 2 ECS services which uses the EFS storage to 0, allow EFS to 
move to a normal throughput, an then reinstate the applications. Both datasette and datasette-tiles seems to back online
in the evening and canaries also reported positive test results.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>On (2023-08-15)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The datasette alarms was also rasied around 1:05am and it seems the EFS throughput still very high in Production when the 
collection pipleine run, so we start looking for a more permanant solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>The current EFS file system is using “Bursting“ throughput mode. It means the application is throughput-constrained 
(i.e. if it uses more than 80% of the permitted throughput or we have used up all burst credits). 
The burst credits was used up (near 0) when the collection pipeline runs.</p>
<p>We decided to upgrade the EFS to use “Elastic” throughput mode instead. In contrasts to the burst credits way of Bursting 
throughput mode, Elastic throughput mode of EFS automatically scales throughput performance up or down to meet the needs 
of the workload activity. Elastic throughput can drive up to 3 GiBps for read operations and 1 GiBps for write operations 
per file system.</p>
<p>We upgraded the EFS to use “Elastic” throughput mode in the afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>On (2023-08-16)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>No alarms have been raised this morning and all canaries seems running fine.</li>
<li>The EFS throughput are healthy too</li>
<li>ECS tasks are all running fine</li>
<li>We will continous monitoring the platform and the additional cost implications if any.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>On (2023-08-17)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>No alarms have been raised and all canaries seems running fine.</li>
<li>The EFS throughput are healthy as yesterday</li>
<li>We noticed the EFS cost increased by around $8 per day, so decided to re-enable “Bursting“ mode 
for (Dev and Staging) environments to save cost.</li>

<p>On the morning of the 22nd the decision was taken to switch over to the new infrastructure setup in the production
account. We made preparations by adding a service outage banner to the application as we were aware that some downtime
would be experienced while DNS updated globally. After the switchover Lawrence was able to access the new infrastructure
so assumed everything was going to plan. At 2:45pm Paul Downey noted that the site was not accessible and diagnostic
procedures started at that point.</p>

<li>GDS contact confirmed the DNS change had been actioned at 2:15pm</li>
<li>Lawrence observed that the datasette and datasette tiles applications were available on the new domain at 2:20pm</li>
<li>Lawrence observed that the main application was available at 2:35pm</li>
<li>Paul Downey observed that the site was still not accessible for him and posted the results of a dig on the main
application domain at 2:50pm</li>
<li>Lawrence used the site https://www.whatsmydns.net/#NS/planning.data.gov.uk to check for propagation and noted that
most DNS servers had updated to the new environment at 3pm</li>
<li>Paul Downey observed that the website worked for him at 4pm</li>
<li>Lawrence and Paul Downey observed that the site was working intermittently from 4pm to 6pm.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NEXT DAY (2022-11-23)</strong>
* Paul Downey observed that the site worked for him when tethered to his phone but saw that one in three runs of dig
    against the domain returned empty results at 9am
* Paul Downey posted into the digital planning slack to advise that we thought the change went through and to let the
    team know of any issues at 9am
* Lawrence observed that some DNS servers had longer TTLs for the domain compared to the current and old DNS records
    TTLs of 24 hours at 1pm
* The decision was made to wait out the full 48 hours of TTL and continue work to solve the issues afterwards at 1:30pm</p>
<p><strong>NEXT DAY (2022-11-24)</strong>
* Paul Downey noted that the DNS responses where still not returned consistently when running a dig command at 8:30am
* Lawrence ran some diagnostics against a selection of public DNS servers and noted that the data.gov.uk domain has two
    sets of DNS servers: AWS and Google Cloud. Lawrence found that running a dig against AWS servers for the domain
    returned details for the new domain whereas running a dig against the Google Cloud returned no results at 10am
* Lawrence drafted a message to be sent to GDS detailing the issues with the Google Cloud nameservers at 10am
* GDS confirmed the issue and confirmed they had synced AWS and Google Cloud nameservers at 11:50am
* Paul Downey observed that the site was up and running for him at 11:55am
* Lawrence completed further checks and noted that most global DNS servers had updated to the new infrastructure at 12pm</p>

<p>We felt the team reacted well to this outage and stakeholders were understanding of the downtime.</p>
<p>Paul Smith developed a pattern for service status messages to users and added feedback to the
<a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/266">GOV.UK Design system</a>.</p>
<p>In reflection the team could have recognised the issues sooner and checked more details of the DNS configuration.</p>
<p>We could have offered the old address https://digital-land.info to OSL and other groups as a fallback while the system
was down.</p>
